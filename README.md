#Offset

## Features

The Offset Tool is intended to be used as an extension to the existing Buffer tool already found in ArcMap.  Essentially, this tool functions like the Copy Parallel... tool found in the Editor toolbar, but does not require an active edit session.  It is much like the Buffer tool, but produces offset geometry with mitered corners.  This idea has been proposed as an [ArcGIS Idea](http://ideas.arcgis.com/ideaView?id=087E0000000176YIAQ).

1. Requires an input shapefile.
2. Requires a user specified Offset distance.
2. Requires an output shapefile location.

## Instructions

1. Download the package.
2. Using ArcMap, browse to Toolbox.tbx and double-click on Offset to launch the tool.
3. The tool should require no modifications.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 or higher
